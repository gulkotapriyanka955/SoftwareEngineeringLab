Project Introduction
When working on a project, most people will want to save files generated in the Cloud9 development environment to a shared repository outside of this EC2 VM. 
One reason is to prevent code loss if something goes wrong with this AWS VM.
Furthermore, several developers may be working on the same project, and they may wish to modify files and store them outside of their environment in a central location.
This is the primary reason for using GitHub.
A large number of open-source projects are created here.


Major steps

1. Sign in to Github account
2. Create a new repository on github
3. To create a new environment on cloud9
4. Insall Git in Cloud9 environment
5. Clone remote github repository with Cloud9 so a two way connection exists
6. Create python files in python environment
7. Push these files to Github
